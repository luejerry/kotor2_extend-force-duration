Increased Force Buff Durations 1.0
- created by cyricc on Jan 11 2016

Compatibility
-------------
Compatible with TSLRC 1.8.4.
Not compatible with any Kotor2 mod that also overrides k_sp1_generic.ncs, i.e. any other force power mod.


About
-----
This mod increases the durations of beneficial force powers by a factor of 2-3x to make recasting
them less annoying. Not long enough to fire and forget, but enough to actually last through most battles.
